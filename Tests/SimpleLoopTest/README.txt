This test checks if the monitor point provided by a plugin 
are published in the BSDB and elaborated by a DASU to generate
an alarm.

This test runs
* a simple plugin with only one monitor point
* a converter
* one Supervisor, with only one DASU and only on ASCE
* the ASCE, with the MinMaxTf, generates one alarm
  depending on the value of the monitor point
  received by the plugin 
* the JSON CDB is in the test folder
* the JSON configuration file of the plugin
  is in the test folder

The value of the monitor point generated by the plugin changes
from the bottom allowed value to the top allowed value 
at regular time intervals triggering the setting/unsetting 
of the alarms by the DASU.
