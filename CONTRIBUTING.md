# Welcome
Thanks a lot for your interested in the Integrated Alarm System (¦AS)
People like you helps a lot making the Integrated Alarm System a great tool.

Any type of contribution is very appreciated: reporting feedback, testing, mindstorming, developing, writing documentation.

## First steps in the ¦AS

The ¦AS [web site](https://integratedalarmsystem-group.github.io) explains the need of such a alarm system for the [ALMA radiotelescope](http://www.almaobservatory.org/) but the tool is independent of ALMA.

We suggest to read the documents whose links are at the bottom of the ¦AS home page to have a picture of the architecture and design of the project.
You can [checkout](https://github.com/IntegratedAlarmSystem-Group), [install](https://github.com/IntegratedAlarmSystem-Group/ias/wiki/Build-and-run) and run the tool yourself.

Being still at a very early stage of the project, the only things you can run are the tests.

## Contributing

If you find something you would like to contribute on, a new feature to implement, a bug to fix, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the ¦AS repository and create your branch to work on.

Tickets being already worked on have the `In progress` label.

A good branch name starts with the number of the ticket followed by short a descriptio , usually the title of the ticket itself like for example
`10-Add-a-type-field-to-the-Identifier`.

`git checkout -b 10-Add-a-type-field-to-the-Identifier`
