# Welcome
Thanks a lot for your interested in the Integrated Alarm System (¦AS)
People like you helps a lot making the Integrated Alarm System a great tool.

Any type of contribution is very appreciated: reporting feedback, testing, mindstorming, developing new features and tests, writing documentation.

We will be very pleased to know you: drop us an email, introduce yourself and do not hesitate to be part of the ¦AS team even if not sure you want to contribute.  
 
The ¦AS [web site](https://integratedalarmsystem-group.github.io) explains the need of such a alarm system for the Atacama Large Millimiter/Submillimiter Array, the [ALMA radiotelescope](http://www.almaobservatory.org/) but for many reasons the tool itself is independent of ALMA and can be run in any environment.
Nevertheless, joining the project will give you the opportuninty to be in contact with the [ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/) and European Southern Observatory [ESO](http://www.eso.org) developers.

## First steps in the ¦AS


As a good starting point, we suggest to read the documents whose links are at the bottom of the ¦AS home page to have a picture of the architecture and design of the project.
You can [checkout](https://github.com/IntegratedAlarmSystem-Group), [install](https://github.com/IntegratedAlarmSystem-Group/ias/wiki/Build-and-run) and run the tool yourself.

Being still at a very early stage of the project, the only things you can run are the tests.

## Contributing

If you find something you would like to contribute on, like providing a new feature or test or fixing a bug, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the ¦AS repository and create your branch to work on.

A good branch name starts with the number of the ticket followed by short a descriptio , usually the title of the ticket itself like for example
`10-Add-a-type-field-to-the-Identifier`.

`git checkout -b 10-Add-a-type-field-to-the-Identifier`

Tickets being already worked on have the `In progress` label.
You can still spend your time on such tickets on your own or joining the other developers working on that.

Bug fixes and new features are always accompanied by one or more unit tests.

## Pull requests

Once your bug fix or new feature is complete and with a proper testing, [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) in github to let the Integrated Alarm System administrators include your changes in the master branch.
To ease our work, please ensure that your fix is up-to-date with the last content of the master branch.

## Final conmsiderations

We wish to thank you for interest even if at the end you decide to not join the project.

Any feedback, even the negative ones, are always very welcome and we take them in great consideration so please do not hesitate to drop us an email or submit tickets.
